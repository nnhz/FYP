# Final Year Project 2020
An Investigation of the Coherent-to-Diffuse Power Ratio and its Application to Speech Dereverberation

This repository contains all the code scripts used for the project, including
* Room Impulse Response (RIR) examples
* CDR investigations (adapted from the demo code by Schwarz et al.)
* CDR applied to dereverberation and evaluation

The scripts uploaded are only for academic purposes and any external dependencies or helper functions used are not included to avoid plagiarism. References are included in individual scripts as well as the project final report.
